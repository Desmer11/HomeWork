        <p>The Pembroke Welsh Corgi (Welsh for "dwarf dog"),
        <br>is a herding dog breed, which originated in Pembrokeshire,
        <br>Wales. It is one of two breeds known as Welsh Corgi:
        <br>the other is the Cardigan Welsh Corgi.
        </p>
        <p>
        <br>The Corgi is proportional to larger breeds but has shorter legs,
        <br>yet has a sturdy appearance and an athletic body that helps it herd
        <br>livestock such as poultry, sheep and cattle.

                <h3>Physical characteristics</h3>
                <p>
                <br>Pembroke Welsh Corgis are 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30 cm) tall from their feet to the top of their shoulders.
                <br>The length from the shoulders to the set on of the tail is 40 percent longer than their height. 
                <br>Pembrokes in peak athletic condition weigh Male: 25 to 30 pounds (11 to 14 kg) with 27 pounds (12 kg) considered as Show Condition, 
                <br>Female: 23 to 28 pounds (10 to 13 kg) with 25 pounds (11 kg) considered as Show Condition. They reach their full height by 9 months old, 
                <br>but their bodies keep filling out until they reach full maturity at two years. Pembrokes have a big appetite, so they can weigh up to 38 pounds (17 kg) 
                <br>if allowed to overeat. Pembroke Welsh Corgis can benefit from portion control and exercise. This is important to monitor, since their legs are so short.

                    as needed.
